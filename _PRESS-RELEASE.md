## Who We Are
___
> "Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the gravities of terrestrial life." - H.G. Wells, *The Time Machine* 
>
People love artistic depictions of the world. For us at Bespinterest, we love to think about what the world could be. What we don't love is how hard it can be to find a good community of like-minded individuals, so we made our own. We invite you to join us and see what Bespinterest can offer your inner creative. 

## What We Do
___
An enormous portion of the science fiction world is based in language. Think of the countless Wikis, libraries, and authors to pull from. We know the best way to indulge yourself with those are to start reading them. Instead, we offer a way to present visual media, a personal interpretation of the universe we all reside in.

## Getting Started
___
It's easy. We do actively encourage (and enforce) anyone who joins us to create a profile prior to viewing our public board. This is a community, one that works best when all components work in unison. Once you've made an account, feel free to view the posts and save them to your own personal boards. We encourage everyone to contribute! All posts are made available in the public space, so don't be afraid to share your thoughts.
